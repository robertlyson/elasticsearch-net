# Features
Some urls in Elasticsearch take a {feature} enum
RouteValues in NEST are represented as classes implementing IUrlParameter
Since enums can not implement interfaces in C# this route param is represented using the Features class that can
be implicitly converted to from the Feature enum

Using the constructor directly is possible but rather involved 

[source, csharp]
----
Features fieldString = Feature.Mappings | Feature.Aliases;
Expect("_mappings,_aliases")
				.WhenSerializing(fieldString);
----
Here we new an GET index elasticsearch request whichs takes Indices and Features.
Notice how we can the Feature enum directly.

[source, csharp]
----
var request = new GetIndexRequest(All, Feature.Settings | Feature.Warmers);
----
